## It would appear I have been away

I promice I haven't left this blog to die. I'm around and still working on things.

I have a few projects I have been working on and need to write up to post on here.

I did get the Pwnagotchi built after a few issues. I never got that wrote up which I regret as I have missplaces it, 
so I have now got a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and a Waveshare V4 eink screen to build another ujpdated Pwnagotchi. I promice I will write up this one. 

Along with the pwnagotchi I purchaced a few other items. One being a [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). I decided not to get the wifi dev board to go with it as I wanted to build my own.
This is a write up I am curently working on, and will possably  change as I wasn't happy with how my build went so I now have a [ESP32-WROOM-32U](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001438925793.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.37.673e1802q3KQhc) so I can use an external antenna and bost the range.

Another purchace I made was for a [Wardriver Rev3 PCB](https://www.tindie.com/products/jhewitt_net/portable-esp32-wardriver-pcb-only/) to build the [Wardriver.uk](https://wardriver.uk) ESP32 based wardriver. I am just waiting on the last few parts to arrive so I can make a start on putting it together. I may have made a slight error with the resistor I needed, I seem to have purchaced a box that contains 2600 resistors of different ratings. At least I have at least one spare incase I make an error soldering it in place.
