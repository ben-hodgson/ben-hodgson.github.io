Over the last few years I have gathered a few Raspberry Pi 0Ws. These had been spaced over my desk either gathering dust while I found something to do with them or they had little things running on them such as my DHT11 and BMP280 for temperature and humidity.

I designed a quick plate to attach the Raspberry Pi 0s to using m2.5 screws. I used some from [this Amazon seller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0894D654R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). As the plates can be stacked I created holes near the corners to fit m2.5 standoff I used [these ones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08HLJ7C6S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.

The files to print are available on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/117043-raspberry-pi-zero-stack-plate).
