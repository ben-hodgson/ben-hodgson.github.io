## Long time no see.

It has been a long time since I have done anything with this. I haven't been lazing around too much.

I have been busy with life and with my degree. I decided to add an update to here and found that I had broken my Hugo install so I thought I'd look for a new theme that had a dark and light mode as I prefer the darker themes but I know others don't. In doing do I discovered one that I liked but it was for Jekyll so I've now moved over to that. It seems like a very popular choice of theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/issues). I think its looking good, I have a few problems with it that I hope to get sorted soon such as loading images stored locally in posts and some other bits to properly setup but that shouldn't take too long. 


I hope to start posting more on here with what I'm up to and working on.
One thing I have been having a look at is the [Pwnagotchi](https://pwnagotchi.ai) project as a learning tool for both cyber security and for Raspberry Pi's. Looking at it I may build it and add a real-time clock which will need soldering.

I think that's all I have for this update so stay tuned for more, hopefully not in 6 months or more.
