## Update on where I am.

This is just a quick update as to where I am and what I’ve been up to. I have been working a lot at my job and uni work so I haven’t had too much time to do any projects lately. I have started designing an Avengers logo to 3d print and create a nightlight out of for my son. I have also had an idea that I’ve started work on for a mpg log for my car. I have the calculations working with a python script that I will be putting on here soon. I think my plan for the mpg log is to look at doing something in Django to have a webpage working for it. I’m not sure on how I want to store the data though I’m more comfortable with a csv but trying to store the data in a sql database would be more challenging for me but that's a while off yet.

Anyway that's it for now, I’ll get the mpg script on here soon-ish.
