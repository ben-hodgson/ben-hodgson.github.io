## Well Iâ€™ve not updated this in a long time

I am still around, I have just been busy with work and Uni so not had much time to create things. I have done a couple of bits in regards to 3d printing and a little bash script to update my Pi's and NUC.

But other than that it has been a busy time learning Java and now cyber security for my degree. I will be starting on my journey through the CCNA come October too.

This is all I will update with for now but I will get the 3d models and the bash script up in the next couple of days.
